okay, so minux is basically a pseudo-operating system made in python
hugely inspired by linux, you know like that operating system
that was made by 2/1 guy(s) for funny because they are the
ones that started GNU movement (i honestly call linux linux instead of GNU/Linux)

the reason why i didn't pick assembl(y)(er) is because these are way too hard
and i am already buttfucking c++ only because of the source engine modding
even tho "iTs nOt tHaT hArD" bro shut the fuck up whoever said that

and also it is a funny project me and my friend are doing

(linux on python :hilarious:)
